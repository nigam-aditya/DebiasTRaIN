This folder contains the ipynb notebook that implements the Debias TRaIN method to construct prompts. 
The notebook makes use of the file bias_template.py for template based training, which in turn uses the two json files for dataset construction. 
(These bias_template.py and json files are taken from - https://github.com/ChiscaAndrei/prompting-fairness)

To execute, simply run the ipynb notebook with the other files in the same directory.
